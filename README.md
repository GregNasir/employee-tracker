# Description

The employee tracker application uses the command line to add and update information in a company's database. the inquirer module in nodejs was used to formulate questons. Other tools used were:

* Javascript 
* Node.js
* Run tests using nmp juest
* Timely commits to GitHub repository to save work
* Mysql to store data

Working on the employee tracker has really given me in-depth knowledge, on the ins and out of mysql. From command line syntax to files association with databases.
